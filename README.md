## Part 1 

## Part 2

 - **Repository:** It is like a "project" and contains all the project files as well as the documentation behind it. It stores every revision made on a file, creating a detailed history for every repository made. It can contain many collaborators and can be either public or private.
   - *For example, if you want to work on a new project, go to github.com and click "create a new repository." Then, create a name, choose a license, and format it as needed as per the requirements of the project*
   
 - **Clone:** This command makes a copy of the repository that is located on your computer. The user can edit the files and use Git to keep track of the changes made without having to be online. It is connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two or the user can push local changes to the remote to keep them synched when they're online.
   
 - **Fork:** Is a command that makes a personal copy of another user's repository and moving it to the user's own account. It allows the user to make changes without affecting the original copy of the program. Forks are always still connected to the original repository so the user can submit a pull request to the original user to add your changes.
   - *You are working on a project with a group. The leader of the group who has created the repository will give you the URL to locate the project on github. You will then click the "fork" button and would then work on the project on the forked version of the repsoitory.*
   
 - **Branch:**  It is a separate copy of the program that is a parallel version of a repository. It allows the user to work on a copy of the program with the assurance that the master branch is not messed with. Afterwards, once the required or needed additions are made, the user can merge the branch they are currently working on with the master branch. By creating a branch, you are creating a copy of the master branch and thus using the latest version saved onto the master branch.
    - *You are working on a project with other people on github. The creator of the repository will have access to the master branch and any changes they make will go straight to it. However other members working on the project will have to create another branch and work on the project from there.*
    
 - **Commit:** A commit is a change or revision to a file(s). Everytime you commit something, it creates a unique id that allows the user to keep track of the changes that were or are being made and by whom and when. It contains a comment section (commit message) that is a short description about the changes made. 
    - *You are working on a project on github, and make some changes. You will scroll down and click the green "commit" button to save your edits. Before you do so, you can also add a message to describe the changes you've made to the project. With every commit, a history log is created with a different id to keep track of the changes being made including information such as by whom and when.*
    
 - **Merge:** A merge is when you take the branch you are currently working on and combine it with another branch.
    - *For example, you are the leader of a project on github. When your group members make changes, it will not go directly to the master branch. They must first send in a pull request, which you must accept, and then merge their changes with the master branch version of the project.*
    
 - **Checkout:** A GitHub command used to switch branches in a repository.
    
 - **Push:** When you send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
   - *For example, you work on a repository and change a couple of things. First you have to commit these changes and include a message if you would like. Then, you have to push the changes so that other users can have access to them.*
   
 - **Pull:** When you are bringing in changes and merging them.
    - *For example, if you are a team member of a group project on github but are not the leader of it and thus any changes you make to the project will not be automatically added to the master branch. You will have to create a pull request that the leader must then accept and then merge yoru changes to the master branch.*
    
 - **Remote Add:** Adds a new remote. It takes two arguments: a remote name and a remote URL. Git remote connects the user's local repository to the remote server.
    
 - **Remote Remove:** Removes a remote along with any remote-tracking branches and configuration settings associated with that remote.
    
 - **Remote Show:** This command displays information about the remote name.
    
 - **Status:** A status is a type of status check that are external processes which then run for each commit the user makes in a repository. Status checks allow the user to know if their commits match the condition set for the repository that they are contributing to. The result of a status check can be pending, passing, or failing.
    
 - **Master Branch:** The default branch that should always contain the most currently updated version of code. Before you code, you have to pull the master branch because it contains the latest update of the coding project.
    - *When you create a new repository, any changes you make by default will go to the master branch. If you are working on a forked version of the proejct or have created another branch, then none of your chnages will be added to the master branch by default. You must first commit your changes, create a pull request, then the leader must merge both version, original and edited, together to get the updated version of the project.*
