## Part 3 (Paulina Ortiz)
 - step one: Go to https://github.com
 - step two: Create your personal account by entering your personal details 
 - step three:To begin working on Github you need to create a project repository.
 - step four: Near the upper right corner click on New repository. 
 - step five: Name the repository as you wish. 
 - step six: Write a brief description on your project.
 - step seven: Then select Initialize this repository with a README.
 - step eight: Share the link to your repository with your group members
 - step nine: Each member needs to fork the project by clicking the Fork button 
 -step ten: Alternatively, members can create a branch by selecting the drop down that reads master branch and entering a name for their branch 
 - step ten: Edit the repository by clicking the edit pen icon 
 - step eleven: Once you are done adding to the README. file, scroll down the page and click on the propose file changes button 
 - step tweleve: From there you must request a pull the request
 - step thirteen: the owner of the project must accept the pull request to commit the changes 

If you group chooses to use branches instead of forking, then the following will help resolve merge conflicts. 
One can use branching to help avoid merge conflicts by structuring the branch tree in advance. A merge conflict occurs when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.

For example, the following would create a merge conflict.
If I wrote "one" to the text file and committed it to master branch.
Then if I created a new branch from the master branch and wrote "two" in the file. 
Finally, if I created a third branch from master and wrote "three" in the file.
There will be a conflict when you merge branch 3 to the master branch because both "two" and "three" are written in the second line of the code. Git does not know if you want to keep "three" or "two" so a merge conflict error shows. 
To solve this merge conflict one would go to "pull requests" and click resolve conflicts. From there the conflict will be outlined in red and in this case to solve the conflict, the word "three" in the third branch would have to be written in the third line of code instead of the second or be deleted all together. 

Forking vs Cloning
Forking is a copy of the repository and lets you make edits to the code without affecting the orignial code. Forking is different then cloning because a relationship exists between your fork and the orgnial repository. 
Cloning is when you download a copy of the repository to your computer. Cloning is different than forking because if the project is owned by someone else, you won't be able to make contributions unless you are invited as a collabortor.
